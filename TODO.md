## Guzzlecal TODO

* Move Mutators to separate namespace and class(es).
* Determine whether or not to use a new class for PATCH operations or just allow array based manipulation
* Consider implementations on other platforms (Codeigniter?)
  * Would a symlink from `libraries` to the vendors directory make sense?
